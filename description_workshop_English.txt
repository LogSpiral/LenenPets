Preface:
Yabusame chan has the ability to across dimensions, right?
Since they don't know when Tsurubami will come back from outside world,
And thank's to another baka in the outside world, there's no EVENT in Mugenri for a long time.
This work might be too boring, thinks Yabusame chan.
One day they meet [[someone]] when walking
"Want a more interesting time?" the one said as this.
Well, with this one's cheat,
we don't know whether the entire Mugenri transport a new world by Yabusame
or a new world transport to Mugenri
Surely, Yabusame chan seems to make a huge fault, right?
(Infomation above from Kuzu Suzumi)
